# Git: Unauthorized Github access

The GitHub app tried to make a request to GitHub, but failed due to unauthorized access.

This error can occur when your GitHub access token expires. Note that GitHub access tokens are managed for you by installing the Prismic GitHub app and is not something you need to manage manually.

## How to fix the issue

If the error occurs continuously, try the following steps:

1. On GitHub, uninstall the Prismic GitHub app.
2. In Slice Machine, navigate to the Settings page and re-install the Prismic GitHub app.
