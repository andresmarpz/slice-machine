# Git: Repository not linked

The Git repository contains Slice Machine, but it was not connected to a Prismic repository from within Slice Machine.

A Git repository must be linked to a Prismic repository before the GitHub app can interact with them.

## How to fix the issue

Connect the Git repository to the project's Prismic repository:

1. Navigate to Slice Machine's Settings page.
1. Connect the GitHub repository.
1. When asked for a Write API token, provide a valid token.

Tokens can be created following these steps:

1. In the Prismic repository, navigate to the Settings page.
1. Select **API & Security** in the sidebar and the **Write APIs** tab at the top of the page.
1. Create and copy a new Write API token or copy an existing token.
